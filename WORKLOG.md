### date 5/22

started making basic classes and drew diagram and separate work
tried to add the picture of the diagram at home

### date 5/23

learned ez super basic level of matrix multiplication and how to find the inverse of a matrix and coded encrypt method, started on coding the inverse of the key matrix
at home, finish all the functions and made a testing branch, it's wrong rn but i will fix it
did testing, trying to figure out problem

### date 5/24

in class: finish float[][] and allow input of various length
at home: did a bit of testing, it's mostly working, or enough for mvp but needs tweaking, the determinent seems off
also got mvp done for the encrypting part, gonna work on making it available in different matrixes

### date 5/25

in class: did more testing, and figured out the problem
at home: it only works for invertible and modable matrixes but at least now it works, time to work on allowing lowercase number and space too
fix the problem now any workable key works and allows lowercase number and space
