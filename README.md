## Overview

This is a cipher encryption and decryption tool. It uses a graphical interface with interactive elements such as buttons and text boxes. The primary cipher used is hill cipher, but it also features other simple ciphers such as Morse Code and Caesar Shift. The key that is used to encrypt the message will be displayed to help the user better understand how the message is being encrypted. There is also a newKey button in case the user want to generate a new key (does not work for Morse Code though).

## Instructions

1) open the file in processing
2) use the dropdown to determine which type of cipher you want to use (Hill Cipher, Caesar, or Morse Code)
3) in the textinput box, type in the message you want to encrypt or decryption
4) press the encrypt of decrypt button right on top of the textinput box
5) press newKey if you want to generate a new key
  - Hill Cipher: generates a random 2x2 matrix as the new key
  - Caesar: rot++ (increase the rotation by one)
6) the encrypted message will replace the original message you inputted in textinput and the corresponding value to your input will be highlighted in the key
